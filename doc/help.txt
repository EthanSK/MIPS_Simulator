good links:


//super useful this one;
https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~csci320/mips_web/ for converting to instructions to binary and finding out info about them

https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_help.html - info about insruction types

useful: http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~ece369/Resources/spim/MIPSReference.pdf

linked from the dude http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html - good summary of all functions 


from here  https://github.com/m8pple/arch2-2018-cw/issues/14  ->
